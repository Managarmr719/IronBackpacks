To Do:

    NOW:
        Add in shift right click functionality
        Add it all as an upgrade

        The IDs don't change, it is what the ID maps to. So large picture is add the new upgrade as id #20 and implement custom handling for it to be treated as a normal IUpgrade.


    Misc Ideas:
        Tooltip for storage emphasis shows how much space?
            Add in description instead?
        Add it so need upgrade specialization for certain upgrades?
        look at Botania for tutorialIfFirstUse
            Set of GuiScreens with informational tooltips/textboxes that you click through to see all the ways to use a backpack
            Expand this idea so when you make an (i.e. AdvancedFilter) for the first item, shows popup for the nifty things for it.
        Different models/textures for upgrade/storage emphasis (more pockets vs bigger model)
        Order tooltip for backpack upgrades alphabetically?



    1.10 ToDo:

        Add fancy label to incr. tier recipe for showing it keeps its inventory and whatnot.

        Documentation (incl. github read me/wiki/cf page) like Refined storage
            Ask Cyanide X in a week to retexture my page (logo/banner/etc)

        Features:

            Backpacks:

                Make them dyeable (I don't use damage values, I might as well)

                eventual integration with travelers gear, tiCon (backpack slot), baubles, etc.

                add to info JEI description explanation of values in shift pressing

            API:
                Add backpack tab (like TiCon)
                    Add in clickable tab with icon and tooltip (in the correct location even if TiCon, etc, is installed)
                    Render steve backwards so you can see the backpack
                    Add in slot for the backpack to go on
                    Optional
                        Add in upgrade removal stuff
                            Slot to put pack in
                            Slot to take pack out of
                            Upgrade to remove slot
                            Button to iterate through upgrade to remove

                add IFilterUpgrade?

                refactor totally

                Move over capabilities to API

            Upgrades:
                cleanup event restocking
                make event upgrades not sort the backpack before doing their things!

                make the upgrades cheaper overall, introduce t1 and t2 crafting bases?

                make crafting advanced filter

                some upgrade to increase storage slots?
                    rows and columns?
                    probably not

                add a way to remove additional upgrade points upgrades?

            JEI:
                 minor: tooltips have slightly lager space between first line and second, remove that


            Investigate:
                add crafttweaker support
                Send packet to client when join server to sync (metas?) configs up

            Crafting:

                Remove adding crafting item to API?
                    https://github.com/WayofTime/BloodMagic/blob/1.8-Rewrite/src/main/java/WayofTime/bloodmagic/item/ItemSlate.java

                Make basic recipe use less leather?

            Other:

                Change depth upgrade description to be more clear on which backpack is nested
                ReAdd Botania integration
                Add more achievements
                When trying to make conflicting recipe, add tooltip explaining for output
                Add analytics (see bagginses / https://github.com/NPException/GameAnalyticsAPI)
                Add commands for storing/loading backpack data
                    Will involve some fileIO for NBT data, not a trivial thing
                Support Crafttweaker special recipes?

                Some super fancy intro popup that shows to a user semi-hidden features on first use (like the ability to right click backpacks inside another).




        Bugs:

            Minor:
                Fix offhand restocking
                    Add onBlockPlaced event for restocking - Need forge PR to go through - https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/3270
                Fix informational tooltip and GuiInputField overlapping
                translation files, make their character escapes equal to en_us

                Check that it works with new forge and IItemHandler
                    https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/2385

                    <pauljoda> https://github.com/TeamBR-Modding/Bookshelf/blob/1.8/src/main/scala/com/teambr/bookshelf/util/InventoryUtils.scala
                    <pauljoda> That code will allow you to move items between inventories, supports old inventories and the new ones by wrapping old objects to the new system
                    <pauljoda> https://github.com/TeamBR-Modding/Bookshelf/blob/1.8/src/main/scala/com/teambr/bookshelf/common/tiles/traits/Inventory.scala
                    <pauljoda> This holds our inventory code on the new system, we kept the old methods for internal use as they work well. But others can't access them unless they are using Bookshelf
                    <pauljoda> https://github.com/TeamBR-Modding/Bookshelf/blob/1.8/src/main/scala/com/teambr/bookshelf/common/tiles/traits/InventorySided.scala
                    <pauljoda> That wraps the sidedness
                    <pauljoda> For the sided, you must override hasCapability in the tile entity. Otherwise it won't work
                    <gr8pefish> thanks, I'll look through that
                    <pauljoda> No problem, feel free to ask me if you have any questions. If I'm not here, try #neotech

                tehnut's advanced tooltips?

            Gradle:
                Add sources/api/javadoc/etc. jars to curseforge upload, make sure they work too

            Config:

                finish redoing it

                bm blacklist for config to disable items (requested config option)

                add blacklist for items the backpack can't be equipped with in armor slot (i.e jetpacks)

            CurseForge/MCF:
                Add that you need java 8 for 2.x.x and up
                Fill in wiki with pictures and info about the mod
                Add more pictures to curseforge page

                Check working with Botania

                test everything post-API refactor

            Minor:

            Major:

            Forge:
                ShapedOreRecipes not working with getRemainingItems, report bug.
                    I just overrode it [matches], copying the matches code directly from ShapelessOreRecipe, and it works. So I think it actually might be some sort of forge bug where those recipes aren't registered properly, or it doesn't call the OreRecipes correctly or something else, I'm not sure.



    NOW:

		
    SOON:

        GIT STUFF:

        REFACTOR:

        TESTING:


        BUGS:


        ADDITIONS/TWEAKS:
            Tick Handler
                Crafting upgrade onItemPutInBackpack (so for manually putting items in)

            Open right click direct from 'e' inventory?

            Have quick deposit upgrade work with equipped backpack
                use a keybinding?

            Have depth upgrade apply to the IBlockProvider --> wait for Vazkii API update

            Add ender upgrade(s)?
                depthEnder - allows you to use the filter/restocking to go into an ender pouch in the inventory
                vanillaEnder - vanilla ender chest linked backpack (with backpack able to take upgrades)
                remoteEnder - or specified filter linking to a specific chest

            Add in more inter-mod compatibility
                right click in my backpack to open TE satchels, golden bag of holding, etc.
                    test this

            Make it so you can't move the opened backpack with number key presses, as there might be some dupe bug using that that I missed

            Add Baubles integration as belt slot to equip
                config option to toggle between?
                Traveler's gear compat too

            crafting upgrade check if backpack is full (#31)
                should do a different long-term solution because you can maybe make less slots even if the backpack is full with crafting
                so a simple check for 'do all the slots have items' isn't sufficient. I should check if it has anything but a tiny crafting
                upgrade since the other two can condense item slots (assuming there is space for them to put the new items).

        EXTRA:

            Fancier config updating/replacing values
                See botania, vazkii is going to implement something similar
                    check current version somehow and compare to origin/versions.txt, if less then do something

            fancy crafting upgrade - choose 1 or 2 or 3 diameter w/ button underneath (like adv. filter)

            mining filter - change so it picks up cobble and smooth stone too and remove from alt gui?

            change it so an entityItem looks to fill a stack in the player's inv before going in filter?

            quick deposit into AE terminals - have to check efficient of deposit code for that to work probably

            add in hard mode config option (and subsequent functionality) where the itemBackpack can't be opened directly, it has to be equipped to be open (i.e. only one open at a time)
                hard mode: weight is a factor? Harder nesting recipe for limited space? Some other way to increase space/nesting via gameplay/in-game research/other?
                no shapeless crafting for removal of upgrades, have to use the crafted one specifically


    LATER:

        //Craft any backpack surrounded by planks to turn it into a placeable custom chest/tileEntity and then shapeless craft the chest to get the backpack back (IChestable)
        Place down TileEntityBackpack directly - if the controls can work that way, if not do the chest method
            (IChestable)

        Power/Fluid/Gas Upgrades (dynamic sizing on left side)


    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
        Gui Config

        custom handling with other mods armors special rendering to render my pack in special spots?

        Barrel Backpacks (implement IChestable)
            4 tiers (or upgrade and drops excess items onto ground), or adds barrel slot like a DSU?

        Craft a diamond/barrel/ender (IDyeable) backpack with dyes to color it
